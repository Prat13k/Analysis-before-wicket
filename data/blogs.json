    "title": "Why Virat Kohli Performs Best Under Pressure – A Data Perspective",
    "slug": "data driven cricket future",
    "content": "Cricket has always been a game of pressure. From chasing targets to surviving difficult spells, the mental aspect often separates good players from great ones. When it comes to handling pressure situations, Virat Kohli stands out as one of the finest batsmen of the modern era.\n\nIf we look at match situations where India required more than 6 runs per over in the final 10 overs of a chase, Kohli’s average rises significantly compared to the team average. This is not accidental. His strike rotation, shot selection, and ability to find gaps reduce dot balls, which is a key factor in successful run chases.\n\nAnother interesting data point comes from knockout matches and high-stakes games. Across ICC tournaments, Kohli’s average in pressure matches is notably higher than in bilateral series. This suggests that he thrives when the stakes are highest, a trait shared by very few elite athletes across sports.\n\nWhat makes Kohli special is not just his technique but his decision-making under stress. Data shows that his false shot percentage drops in pressure situations, indicating better shot judgment when it matters most.\n\nIn conclusion, Virat Kohli’s performances under pressure are backed by numbers, not just reputation. His ability to stay composed, rotate strike, and accelerate at the right time makes him one of the most reliable batsmen in modern cricket.",
