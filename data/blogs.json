    "content": "## Afghanistan Squad Analysis\n\n### Overview\nAfghanistan enter the tournament with a clear identity built around all-rounders and spin bowling. Known for performing well in slower conditions, the selected squad reflects a deliberate balance between batting depth and spin dominance. How effectively they execute this approach against teams with strong pace attacks and on faster surfaces will define their campaign.\n\n### Squad Composition & Balance\nAfghanistan have opted for a squad comprising three specialist batters alongside two wicketkeeper-batters. The inclusion of two fast-bowling all-rounders significantly strengthens the team's balance, allowing them to field multiple spin options without compromising batting depth.\n\nThe presence of several spin-bowling all-rounders, capable of contributing lower down the order, gives Afghanistan the flexibility to adapt combinations based on pitch conditions while maintaining bowling variety.\n\nIn the specialist bowling department, the squad includes two frontline spinners and three fast bowlers, featuring a mix of one left-arm and two right-arm pacers. While this provides basic pace coverage, the depth and experience in fast bowling remain limited compared to their spin resources.\n\n### Batting Balance\nAfghanistan's batting unit appears heavily right-hand dominant, with only two left-handed batters included in the 15-member squad. This lack of left-right balance could make the batting order predictable, particularly against quality spin attacks in the middle overs.\n\n### Final Verdict\nAfghanistan possess a squad capable of challenging opponents under favourable, spin-friendly conditions. However, progression beyond the group stage may prove difficult due to limited fast-bowling depth and a one-sided batting lineup. Their success will largely depend on how effectively their batters handle high-quality pace and whether their spin attack can consistently dictate terms on suitable surfaces.",
